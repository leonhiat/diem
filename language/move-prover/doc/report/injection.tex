\SubSection{Specification Injection}

Move specifications -- function specifications, data invariants, and global
invariants -- are transformed in assume/assert statements. While in the actual
implementation this happens as a bytecode transformation, we illustrate the
approach here again by a source level transformation into |spec assert p| and
|spec assume p| Move level statements. As usual, the assert postulates something
which must be proven, and the assume something which can be assumed to hold for
a prove. All specification constructs in Move are reduced to this basic format,
as discussed below.
