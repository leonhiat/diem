/// # Summary
/// Burns the coins held in a preburn resource in the preburn queue at the
/// specified preburn address, which are equal to the `amount` specified in the
/// transaction. Finds the first relevant outstanding preburn request with
/// matching amount and removes the contained coins from the system. The sending
/// account must be the Treasury Compliance account.
/// The account that holds the preburn queue resource will normally be a Designated
/// Dealer, but there are no enforced requirements that it be one.
///
/// # Technical Description
/// This transaction permanently destroys all the coins of `Token` type
/// stored in the `Diem::Preburn<Token>` resource published under the
/// `preburn_address` account address.
///
/// This transaction will only succeed if the sending `account` has a
/// `Diem::BurnCapability<Token>`, and a `Diem::Preburn<Token>` resource
/// exists under `preburn_address`, with a non-zero `to_burn` field. After the successful execution
/// of this transaction the `total_value` field in the
/// `Diem::CurrencyInfo<Token>` resource published under `0xA550C18` will be
/// decremented by the value of the `to_burn` field of the preburn resource
/// under `preburn_address` immediately before this transaction, and the
/// `to_burn` field of the preburn resource will have a zero value.
///
/// ## Events
/// The successful execution of this transaction will emit a `Diem::BurnEvent` on the event handle
/// held in the `Diem::CurrencyInfo<Token>` resource's `burn_events` published under
/// `0xA550C18`.
///
