title: Reporting Vulnerabilities
---

This document outlines security procedures and general policies for the Libra project.

> **Note**: As Libra Core is currently in the prototype stage and does not power a blockchain with a cryptocurrency that has real-world value, our security procedures are not fully in place. We will release a more complete disclosure policy prior to the launch of the mainnet.

## Reporting a Bug

The Libra team and community take all security bugs in the Libra project
seriously to ensure the security of the Libra Blockchain.


Please report security bugs on [Libraâ€™s Bug Bounty with HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/libra).

You can also report security bugs by emailing us directly at [security@libra.org](mailto:security@libra.org).

Thank you for improving the security of the Libra Blockchain! Your efforts and responsible disclosure are appreciated, and every effort will be made to acknowledge your contributions in a timely manner.
