## Documentation

## Pull Requests

During the initial phase of development, we plan to only audit and review the pull requests. As the codebase stabilizes, we will be able to accept pull requests from the community.

To submit your pull request:

1. Fork the `libra` repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you have added code that should be tested, add unit tests.
3. If you have made changes to APIs, update the relevant documentation, and build and test the developer site.
4. Verify and ensure that the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code passes both linters.
6. Complete the Contributor License Agreement (CLA), if you haven't already done so.
7. Submit your pull request.
