On December 16, 2019, the council of the Libra Association voted to establish a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) for the Libra project and elected five members that each contribute a unique perspective and bring valuable domain expertise to the project.

The role of the TSC is to oversee and coordinate the technical design and development of the Libra network. Responsibilities include:

- Directing the technical roadmap for the Libra network
- Forming Technical Working Groups to fast-track research into selected specific issues
- Guiding codebase development
- Building a healthy and engaged Libra developer community

Establishing an independent TSC that is responsible for technical development of the Libra network is an important step forward for the Libra project. It has always been the Association's vision that the Libra project would be self-governing and independent of any one organization's control.

As a project rooted in technological innovation, technical stewardship is a significant component of self-governance for the Libra project. In Q1 2020, the TSC will publish its technical governance framework and associated documents. This will include the process by which the open source community can propose technical changes to the network and a transparent process for evaluating those proposals.

## Meet the TSC members

He holds a Ph.D. in computer science from the Technical University of Lisbon, has worked in software security for over 15 years, and is a published author of several peer-reviewed papers in distributed systems and information security. As an early employee at Square, Diogo led the platform security team that built the infrastructure that Square uses today, in the process developing widely recognized best-in-class production security practices. At Docker, he built and led the security team, and his code today helps secure hundreds of millions of servers worldwide as one of the core underpinnings of modern infrastructure: containers.

> "For the Libra Blockchain to serve billions of users worldwide, security must be its foundation. We are using the best of modern security engineering to prepare the Libra network to operate on a global scale." - Diogo Monica

**George Cabrera III, Libra Core Product Lead at Calibra.** George, a 20-year software engineering veteran, has been working as the product lead for Libra Core for over a year. In the past, George worked as a technical lead at Network Appliance and at Facebook in the Core Data team designing Facebook's core caching system.

Under Joe's leadership, Bison Trails built a reputation as a trusted partner for protocol teams working to develop and deploy new blockchain projects. Joe is one of the world's experts on blockchain network scalability, security, and decentralization: critical areas to a network's adoption and success. As a Libra Association Member, Bison Trails launched the first validator node on the Libra testnet after Calibra and is actively engaged supporting the protocol's development.

> "Our goal is to ensure the Libra network is decentralized, secure, and well-orchestrated, with the infrastructure in place to support billions of transactions. This aligns well with our vision of democratizing access to the decentralized future." - Joe Lallouz
