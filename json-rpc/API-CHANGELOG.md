## 2020-10-08 Decode transaction script as name, code, arguments and type_arguments

- Transaction [Script](docs/type_transaction.md#type-script) is fulfilled with known script name as type, code, arguments and type_arguments. Similar with on-chain transaction [Script](https://developers.libra.org/docs/rustdocs/libra_types/transaction/struct.Script.html) type.
- Renamed type `peer_to_peer_transaction` to `peer_to_peer_with_metadata`, which is consistent with stdlib transaction script name.
