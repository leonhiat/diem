* better error message when request params is invalid
* check account existence to decide whether submit creating account transaction
* return submitted transaction bytes instead of dd account next seq number, client can wait for transaction to know whether the transactions are succeed. wait for account seq number is a bad example of waiting for transaction executed.
* add create dd account endpoint
