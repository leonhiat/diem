# State synchronizer (State sync)

This crate contains state sync v2 -- the next iteration of state sync.
See this [issue](https://github.com/diem/diem/issues/8906) for more
information. Similarly, see the original state sync v1
[README](../state-sync-v1/README.md).

// TODO(joshlind): complete the description of state sync v2 once the
implementation has landed.
